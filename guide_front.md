##Varnam Documentation Project

This guide intends to cover various aspects of the varnam project. You will learn how to set up varnam on your computer and customize it to your convenience. 

####What is varnam?

Varnam is a transliterator. A transliterator is a piece of software that changes the text you type in one language to another language. Varnam was created by [Navaneeth][navaneeth-link] when he was researching about predictive transliterators.

Here is an example of English to Hindi transliteration using varnam :

>bhaarateey -> भारतीय

####Where can I download varnam?

Currently there are no packages available for any operating system. You will have to download the source code and compile varnam. The [getting started][getting_started] guide will tell you how to do that. If you want to jump in and test varnam right away, check out the [online editor](http://www.varnamproject.com/editor). The online editor currently supports transliteration to Malayalam and Hindi from English.

A firefox addon for varnam is available [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/varnam-transliteration-base/). 

#### This guide is so lame. Can I find help somewhere else?

Subscribe to the varnam [mailing list](https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/varnamproject-discuss) (we use [mailman](http://www.list.org/)) and feel free to send an email to varnamproject-discuss@nongnu.org. If you're more into IRC, some of us hang out at **_#varnamproject_** at freenode.
